## Write the way into your heart.

I've started this blog for a multitude of reasons: first and foremost, it serves as an archive of all of my experiences. I enjoy interacting with technology - everything from programming in x86 Assembly to making sense of obscure, proprietary file formats. Naturally, these are very unique and often complex endeavours, and this space allows me to organize my thoughts while sharing them at the same time. 

But secondly, this space is a way to tie two of my favourite things together - computer science, and *writing.* Now, I'm not very experienced in writing in this sort of format, my forte is academic essays. Yet, I believe that this is a way for me to enhance the way that I write informally, and explain interesting concepts along the way, and I hope that whoever comes across this platform will be able to gain something from it. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my short introduction.
